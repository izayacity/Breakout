# GAME-230-Breakout

In Breakout, the classic 1976 video game, the player controls a "paddle" on the bottom of the screen. A ball starts sitting on the paddle until the player launches it. Along the top of the screen are several rows of "bricks". If the ball hits a break, the brick breaks (or is damaged) and the ball bounces off. Once the player clears all of the bricks, they move on to the next level. If the ball falls past the player's paddle, they lose a life. If the player loses all of their lives, the game is over.
